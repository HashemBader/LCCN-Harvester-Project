# LCCN Harvester Project

The LCCN Harvester (the Harvester) is a tool designed to make cataloging easier
for librarians. It takes a list of ISBNs and automatically finds the call
numbers needed for shelving and classification, including Library of Congress
(LCCN) and National Library of Medicine (NLMCN) call numbers. Instead of
searching multiple catalogues manually, the Harvester runs those searches in
one place, collects the results, and keeps them organized for review.

The Harvester stores successful lookups so they can be reused in future runs,
records where each result came from, and produces output files that are easy to
import into local systems or share with colleagues. The goal is to reduce
repetitive work, speed up cataloging, and provide consistent, reliable call
numbers with less effort.

This repository contains the implementation of the Harvester as part of the
CS4820 / CS4810 software engineering project.
