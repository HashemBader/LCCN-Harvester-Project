"Test name","Steps to reproduce","Expected result","Actual result","Pass/Fail","Notes","Who tested + date"
"Input/Harvest Flow","1. Drag and drop valid TSV input 2. View file statistics 3. Click 'Start Harvest'","File validates instantly, displays exact unique/invalid/duplicate count, and harvest begins without crashing","File parses correctly using unified helper, stats match perfectly, pipeline engages seamlessly","Pass","","Eyad Mansour - 24/02/2026"
"Start/Pause/Cancel Controls","1. Click Start Harvest 2. Click Pause 3. Click Resume 4. Click Cancel","Harvest toggles states dynamically and UI updates corresponding button usability (e.g. Pause turns to Resume)","Worker thread correctly pauses yield loop and gracefully interrupts upon Cancel.","Pass","","Eyad Mansour - 24/02/2026"
"Outputs Validation (Success/Failed/Invalid)","1. Upload test validation TSV containing spaces, missing digits, and multiple identical lines","Pre-harvest validates ISBNs exactly correctly, UI splits 'Loaded ISBNs' from total file rows, and live stats reflect exact processing count","Accurately detected 3 unique valid rows minus 3 duplicates and 2 invalids.","Pass","Math formulas for counts were previously mismatched. Rewrote backend to use the exact same parser for both GUI and Database.","Eyad Mansour - 24/02/2026"
"Clear Button Dynamic State","1. Load App (without file) 2. Upload TSV 3. Click 'Clear'","Button is disabled gray initially, turns red 'DangerButton' instantly upon upload, completely clears UI and resets when clicked","Button toggles states perfectly. Emoji/text scaling issue bypassed.","Pass","Had to fix OS-level text clipping by relying on generic DangerButton CSS instead of fixed 30x30 bounding box hacks.","Eyad Mansour - 24/02/2026"
"API/Server Health Checks","1. Open secondary 'API Health' dialog window","Pings LOC, Harvard, OpenLibrary domains simultaneously for latency tests","Responses returned successfully without unresponsiveness.","Pass","","Eyad Mansour - 24/02/2026"
"UI Layout Resizing & Popup Safety","1. Start unified tab 2. Maximize window quickly 3. Shrink to narrow width","Flexible layout components flex appropriately horizontally, errors are printed inline instead of spawning infinite popups","Scroll area anchors and expands. Inline logging successfully avoids OS interrupt popups.","Pass","","Eyad Mansour - 24/02/2026"
